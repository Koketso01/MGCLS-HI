      About the MGCLS–H&nbsp;I database
    </h1>

    <p>
      The <strong>MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS)</strong> is a large programme carried out
      with the 64-dish MeerKAT telescope in South Africa. Between 2018 and 2019, MeerKAT observed
      115 galaxy clusters for 6–10 hours each at L-band (≈900–1670&nbsp;MHz), producing deep, wide-field
      radio imaging with typical sensitivities of a few μJy&nbsp;beam<sup>−1</sup> and angular resolutions of
      ≈8&nbsp;arcsec. The first continuum data release (DR1) provides a rich set of products for studies of
      radio galaxies, diffuse cluster emission and polarisation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>MGCLS–H&nbsp;I project</strong> builds directly on this legacy by exploiting the neutral hydrogen
      (H&nbsp;I 21-cm) line information embedded in the same visibilities. By reprocessing the original
      MGCLS measurement sets in spectral-line mode, the project constructs a homogeneous database
      of H&nbsp;I detections and data products for galaxies in and around MGCLS clusters. This website
      hosts the first H&nbsp;I data release (H&nbsp;I–DR1).

  <!-- 2. Why H I in Clusters? -->
  <section class="mb-4">
    <h2>Why neutral hydrogen (H&nbsp;I) in galaxy clusters?</h2>

    <p>
      Galaxies follow a set of well-known scaling relations that describe their formation and evolution,
      such as the star-formation main sequence linking stellar mass and star-formation rate. Underlying
      these relations is a <strong>gas-regulation cycle</strong>: galaxies acquire gas, store it in their discs,
      convert part of it into stars, expel material through feedback, and may re-accrete gas over cosmic time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neutral atomic hydrogen (H&nbsp;I) is a key component of this cycle. It is a primary reservoir from which
      molecular gas and stars ultimately form, and it is highly sensitive to environmental processes such as
      ram-pressure stripping, tidal interactions and “pre-processing” in groups. Measuring where H&nbsp;I is
      located, how much is present, and how it is removed or redistributed is therefore central to
      understanding how galaxies grow and quench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single-dish surveys (e.g. HIPASS, ALFALFA) have mapped H&nbsp;I over large sky areas but at coarse
      angular resolution, while interferometric surveys (WHISP, ATLAS<sup>3D</sup>, BlueDisk, VIVA, THINGS,
      LVHIS) provide resolved views but typically over smaller areas and with non-uniform depth. As a
      result, the literature still presents a fragmented picture of how H&nbsp;I content links to stellar mass,
      environment and star-formation activity, especially in dense environments such as clusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      MGCLS–H&nbsp;I directly addresses this gap by constructing a
      <strong>homogeneous, cluster-focused, spatially resolved H&nbsp;I dataset</strong> across a well-defined
      sample of galaxy clusters, all observed with the same telescope, frequency setup and reduction pipeline.
    </p>

  <!-- 3. From MGCLS to the MGCLS–H I Database -->
  <section class="mb-4">
    <h2>From MGCLS to the MGCLS–H&nbsp;I database</h2>

    <p>
      The MGCLS–H&nbsp;I project reprocesses the original MGCLS visibilities to extract the 21-cm line signal.
      The available bandwidth and channelisation allow us to trace H&nbsp;I emission over a primary redshift
      range of <strong>0 &lt; <em>z</em> &lt; 0.11</strong> (with additional sub-bands at higher redshift), covering galaxies
      in environments from rich clusters to smaller groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey strategy is to first process the <strong>radio-selected cluster sample with
      <em>z</em> &lt; 0.1</strong>, followed by X-ray selected clusters in the same redshift range. For each cluster,
      a dedicated H&nbsp;I cube is produced over ≈1280–1430&nbsp;MHz, covering the relevant velocity range
      around the cluster systemic redshift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to create a <strong>legacy H&nbsp;I database</strong> that enables robust statistical studies across
      thousands of galaxies and dozens of clusters, with uniform sensitivity, well-documented completeness
      and consistent data products. The database is hosted at Rhodes University, and this website provides
      the first public data release (H&nbsp;I–DR1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of the database and associated workflow has been carried out over a dedicated
      multi-year effort, in close collaboration with MGCLS team members who initiated the early H&nbsp;I
      exploration, tuning of pipeline parameters and design of the database schema. This release represents
      the first step in turning the full MGCLS H&nbsp;I information into a long-lived community resource.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. Processing & Workflow -->
  <section class="mb-4">
    <h2>Processing workflow and data preparation</h2>

    <p>
      The MGCLS–H&nbsp;I data products are derived from the original MeerKAT visibilities using a uniform
      spectral-line reduction and staging workflow. At a high level:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Raw MeerKAT visibilities</strong> are ingested from the science archive.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flagging, calibration and self-calibration</strong> are applied using a standard spectral-line
        reduction pipeline, including radio-frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, cross-calibration and
        iterative self-calibration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Continuum subtraction and line imaging</strong> are performed to isolate the H&nbsp;I line signal,
        producing primary-beam-corrected data cubes on a regular spatial–spectral grid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3-D source finding and parameter extraction</strong> are run on the cubes to identify H&nbsp;I
        emission in position–position–velocity space and to measure basic source properties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Completeness testing with mock galaxy injection and recovery experiments</strong> is used to
        quantify the H&nbsp;I mass and linewidth ranges over which the survey is statistically complete, as a
        function of redshift, linewidth and cube depth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Galaxy-level products</strong> (H&nbsp;I cubelets, moment maps, velocity fields, line profiles and
        masks) are cut out and associated with their parent cluster and catalogued in a consistent schema.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quality assessment and staging</strong> are performed before products are ingested into the
        MGCLS–H&nbsp;I database and exposed through this website.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This end-to-end approach ensures that all clusters in the database are reduced with compatible
      settings and that the resulting catalogues can be used for homogeneous population studies,
      completeness-limited analyses and detailed follow-up work.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Data Products -->
  <section class="mb-4">
    <h2>What is included in MGCLS–H&nbsp;I DR1?</h2>

    <p>
      The first MGCLS–H&nbsp;I data release focuses on a staged subset of MGCLS clusters for which
      the H&nbsp;I cubes and catalogues have passed the current quality checks. For each cluster, the
      database provides:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cluster-level metadata</strong> – basic properties such as redshift, dynamical mass proxies,
        image depth, beam size and H&nbsp;I column-density sensitivity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Primary-beam-corrected H&nbsp;I cubes</strong> – full-field spectral cubes centred on the
        cluster pointing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Galaxy-level catalogues</strong> – H&nbsp;I detections with positions, velocities, integrated
        fluxes, linewidths and a set of basic morphological descriptors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>H&nbsp;I cubelets and moment maps</strong> – small cutouts around each detection, including
        total intensity (moment-0), velocity fields (moment-1) and, where appropriate, velocity-dispersion
        maps (moment-2).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Masks and diagnostic products</strong> – source masks, signal-to-noise maps and quality
        flags that allow users to assess the robustness of each detection.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Multi-wavelength preview figures</strong> – quick-look overlays that combine H&nbsp;I, X-ray
        and optical information for many fields.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- 7. Science Enabled -->
  <section class="mb-4">
    <h2>Science enabled by the MGCLS–H&nbsp;I database</h2>

    <p>
      By combining a well-defined cluster sample with spatially resolved H&nbsp;I measurements, the
      MGCLS–H&nbsp;I database enables a wide range of environmental and evolutionary studies, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>H&nbsp;I content and deficiency in clusters</strong> compared to the field, including trends with
        cluster-centric distance, local density and projected phase-space location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gas stripping and morphological transformation</strong>, tracing truncated H&nbsp;I discs,
        one-sided tails and disturbed kinematics associated with ram-pressure stripping, harassment
        and tidal interactions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pre-processing in groups and filaments</strong>, using galaxies outside the virial radius to
        study how gas is removed before galaxies reach the cluster core.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>H&nbsp;I mass function and scaling relations in dense environments</strong>, enabling
        comparisons with single-dish surveys and constraining how H&nbsp;I fractions depend on stellar
        mass, environment and star-formation activity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Links between H&nbsp;I structure and multi-wavelength tracers</strong>, such as X-ray
        emission from the intracluster medium, optical morphologies and star-formation indicators.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because the database is homogeneous, well-documented and cluster-centric, it is well suited to both
      targeted case studies of individual systems and statistical analyses across the ensemble.
